  <p>In the 195Os, the era in which serious thought was first given to the possibility of computerized
  information searching, it was proposed that search requests might advantageously be
  formulated as <a href="https://www.naver.com" target='_blank' title='네이버_홈'>Boolean combinations</a> of document descriptors. This suggestion seemed to
  meet with the immediate approval of most mathematicians, computer scientists, and technically
  oriented information professionals. At that time only Bar-Hillel, a mathematical
  logician, objected strenuously [I].</p><br><br>

  and in most automated library catalogs. It is also used in the command languages of
  many database management systems, office information systems, personnel search systems,
  and various other information access programs for scholarly, institutional, or personal use.
  In fact, insofar as search systems in actual operation today are concerned, the Boolean
  request form is quite ubiquitous. <p>Thus it may come as a surprise to some readers to learn
  that specialists in information retrieval are by no means unanimous in their praise of the
  Boolean approach, that the research</p> literature is full of alternative proposals, and that
  knowledgeable information scientists who think the standard Boolean design could be significantly
  improved on probably constitute an overwhelming majority.
  Admittedly, there is as yet no clear consensus among researchers a
